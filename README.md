# DevOps-Apprenticeship
Welcome to the "DevOps-Apprenticeship" repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects designed to help you gain hands-on experience with various DevOps tools and concepts, from beginner to advanced levels.

# Overview
This repository aims to provide a structured learning path for individuals interested in DevOps, regardless of their experience level. It includes a diverse range of projects covering various aspects of DevOps, such as version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), containerization, infrastructure as code (IaC), configuration management, monitoring, logging, and more.

# Projects
The projects in this repository are organized into three levels: beginner, mid-level, and senior. Each level contains 10 projects with increasing complexity, allowing you to progressively build your skills and knowledge.

### Beginner Level Projects
Set up a version control system (Git) and create a repository for a simple project
Create a basic website or web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and host it on a web server
Learn Bash scripting and write scripts to automate simple tasks
Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline using a tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions
Learn Docker basics and create a Docker image for a simple application
Automate server configuration and software installation using Ansible or Puppet
Set up a monitoring system for a simple application using Prometheus and Grafana
Automate infrastructure provisioning using Terraform for a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP)
Deploy a containerized application to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using Minikube or kind)
Set up a logging system for a simple application using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)

### Mid-Level Projects
Learn a scripting language like Python or Go and use it for automation tasks
Implement a CI/CD pipeline for a complex multi-component application using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions
Set up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or GCP GKE)
Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform for complex, multi-resource deployments
Implement security best practices for containerized applications and Kubernetes clusters
Implement continuous deployment strategies like blue/green or canary deployments
Build and deploy a microservices-based application using Docker and Kubernetes
Automate configuration management and application deployment using Ansible or Puppet for a large-scale environment
Set up a distributed monitoring and logging system for a complex application using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack
Set up a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for a microservices-based application on Kubernetes

### Senior Level Projects
Implement advanced CI/CD pipelines with features like canary releases, feature flags, and A/B testing
Automate the deployment and management of complex, multi-tier applications using Ansible or Puppet
Implement advanced security measures for containerized applications and Kubernetes clusters, such as network policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and auditing
Implement advanced Terraform configurations for multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments
Contribute to open-source DevOps tools or projects
Design and implement a highly available and scalable cloud-native application architecture using microservices, containers, and Kubernetes
Set up a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment spanning multiple cloud providers or on-premises data centers
Implement advanced monitoring and observability strategies, including distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) and application performance monitoring (APM)
Design and implement a GitOps workflow for managing infrastructure and application deployments using tools like Flux or ArgoCD
Design and implement a self-healing and auto-scaling infrastructure using cloud provider services and Kubernetes
